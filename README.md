# Recipe
This repository aims to contain a software that is able to track your favourite recipes.

Below we will display the interfaces used, and a quick summary of their functionalities.

The first menu bar, depicted above, allowed to: Add; Visualize; Edit; and Remove recipes.

When adding a recipe, the following window will be displayed.

This allows to add both a recipe, and a category (i.e. the "Tiramisu" recipe would be within "Desserts" category).

The recipe content would include:
* Name of the recipe
* Ingredients
* Preparation
* Comment

When visualizing a recipe, the following window will be displayed.

Where the recipe dialog box would prompt the recipes based on the category chosen on its left. Then, after selecting a recipe, the ingredients, preparation and comment would be filled out.

When editing a recipe, the following window will be displayed. This is similar to the visualization window, with the difference that the text boxes are editable, and, therefore, the recipe can be improved.

Note, that throughout the program there are Message Dialog boxes (as shown above) that tell the user whether the recipe has been successfully (or not) edited, added or removed.

Finally, in order to remove a recipe, the following window would be displayed. Where you can either delete a single recipe, or the entire category.

All the recipe database is handled in the most robust possible way :) with plain text files, obviously.
